# Prediction Registration Template
**Version 1.0**

_This template specifies the elements to include when registering theory-based predictions of future events. To use the template, copy the information below or access the template on a Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iq1sbX_YSbOYaAXveBFmI5-wWQPm_VPi-zO4KO6_K4Y/edit?usp=sharing). For background on theory-based predictions, see the article ["Registering Theory-based Predictions"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics) published in_ PS: Political Science & Politics. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the template, please contact Andrew Miller at millera@usna.edu.

## Study Information

### Study Title
State the title of the study. 

### Contributors
State the name and institution for all contributors to the study. Include the contact information for the corresponding author. 

### Version & Date
State the version of the prediction registration document, beginning with Version 1.0 (Day/Month/Year posted) for the first posted registration. When posting updated registrations, list previous versions along with the date uploaded to the registry. All updates will be stored on the project’s registry page. 

### Study Summary
Briefly summarize the study including stating the theory being tested and an outline of the study’s scope conditions. Also describe the purpose of the study, explaining the motivation for making theory-based predictions related to the outcomes of interest. 

### Keywords
Specify the keywords associated with the theory and study registration.

## Theory & Measurement

### Theory Background
Provide background on the theory, including situating it within the broader academic literature. If the theory is based on previously published works, include citations for the works used to formulate the theory for making predictions. If the theory is original in that it has not been published elsewhere, that should be stated explicitly in the registration document.

### Scope Conditions
Specify the theory’s temporal and geographic scope as well as other factors that bound the theory’s applicability. These conditions represent the scenarios in which the researcher expects the theory to apply. 

### Study Variables
Specify the following variables in the theory: 

* Independent variable(s)
* Dependent variable(s)
* Mediating variable(s), if applicable
* Conditional variable(s), if applicable

Specify the direction by which the independent variables influence the dependent variables. Include a directed arrow diagram to clarify the relationships among the theory’s variables, if applicable.

### Variable Measurement
Describe the process used to measure each variable. Specify the source of the raw data as well as how and when they are collected. Also include information on how the data are processed and transformed by the researcher, if applicable. Also specify how missing data is handled such as either dropping cases with incomplete data from the analysis or conducting interpolation. 

### Evaluation Metrics
Specify the metrics that will be used to evaluate the results of the predictions and at what time intervals they are to be measured. The metrics might include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Proportion of predictions correct/incorrect
* Raw count of predictions correct/incorrect
* Brier scores 
* Ranked Probability Scores
* Logarithmic Loss
Explain the rationale for selecting a given metric. If the outcome will be measured by more than one metric, a single primary metric should be chosen and alternate metrics are included as robustness checks. Note that independent variables that do not have the values stated in the predictions should not be counted for or against the theory’s score given that the purpose of prediction registration is to test the theory’s predictive power, which is contingent on the value of the independent variables. 

### Alternative Baseline
Describe a baseline measure of alternative predictions. These alternative predictions might be based on an alternative theory, predictions from superforecasters or artificial intelligence algorithms, or a mathematical baseline such as 50-50 chance. Include all relevant information about the alternative baseline that an independent researcher would require in order to reproduce the results.

## Predictions

### Initial Predictions
Specify the predictions including what the researcher judges to be the independent variable values and the predicted dependent variable values. In addition to this registration document, the researcher may wish to post the predictions in a public forum (website, social media platform, GitHub, etc.) for ease of accessibility. Any posts of the predictions in these fora should include a link to the prediction registration site. 

### Update Criteria
Specify the criteria, if any, for which updates will be made to the initial predictions and describe how the predictions will be monitored to assess the potential need for updates. There are two types of potential updates:
* Conditional Variable Updates: The prediction registration may be updated if a previously out-of-scope case enters the scope of the theory. The change in the case should ideally be to a pre-specified conditional variable, but unanticipated changes to cases can still be used to update the predictions. In addition, cases may be dropped from the list of initial predictions if they become no longer in scope.
* Independent Variable Updates: Independent variable values may be updated if observed developments change their values to values other than the pre-specified values included in the initial predictions. Upon updating the independent variable value, the researcher subsequently recalculates the predicted dependent variable value. 

## Additional Information

### Conflicts of Interest
Disclose any conflicts of interest related to the registration, including financial, that could influence the researcher’s impartiality. If the researcher has any known influence over the value of the variables making up the theory, it should be described in detail in this section.
